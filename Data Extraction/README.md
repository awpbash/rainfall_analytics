Welcome to the Data Extraction subfolder where we extract data (duh) for comparison
Since the data we are working with are of different fomr, ie. Grid vs Point, it will be helpful for us to extract key points then compare them as this will take
less computer power and space then loading the entire file everytime

Input: Grided file (GRIB, NC etc)
Output: CSV

Output format: "Datetime", "Season", "Location 1", ... "Location N"

Usage:
1) Run the GUI to pick points of interests. These points of interest correspond with rain gauges in Singapore. Close GUI after executing
2) Ensure you have updated the directory correctly
3) Run download code and data will be automatically extracted

*For Data.gov and NEA data, just manually search for it in the combined csv and folders respectively
** Data.gov's extraction code is in Data Acquisition itself
